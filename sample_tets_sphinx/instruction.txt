extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.doctest',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
    'sphinx.ext.coverage',
    'sphinx.ext.mathjax'

]

Notes:

By using spinx it will also run the python script, with all the libraries that you have installed and imported to the Raspberry pi,you may install it to your local directory again and run locally.

Bascially if you can run your python script locally,then spinx is able to build the HTML.
